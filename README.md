# Reading Low-Level Programming

Material related to reading the book Low-Level Programming written by Igor Zhirkov.

Note that the author Igor Zhirkov is Russian and you should hence not buy this book as long as the war in Ukraine is ongoing. The book is however widly available for download as a pdf and it is in my opinion just fine to download it as the Russians are currently stealing and destroying everything in Ukraine. What goes around comes around.
